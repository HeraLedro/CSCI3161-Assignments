    ====Roller Coaster====

    Draws a spline and progresses a pair of cameras along set paths: one which
    revolves around the track at a constant speed and another which follows the
    spline at a constant speed. The key commands are as follows:

            q   - quit the program
            a   - rotate camera back by half a unit, usable only in rotate mode
            d   - rotate camera ahead by half a unit, usable only in rotate mode
         space  - change between track mode and rotate mode
